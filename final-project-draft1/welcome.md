# Python Data Structures Tutorial
Welcome to the Python Data Structures Tutorial. By the end of these tutorial you should have a basic understanding of these three data structures:
- [Queues](1-topic.md)
- [Linked Lists](2-topic.md)
- [Trees](3-topic.md)

Each topic will contain detailed explanations of each concept and its terms. It will also have coding examples. At the end of each topic, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
